\begin{abstract}
  This is just a sample \LaTeX template I'm using for quick and dirty documents. I've added a quick demonstration of some basic functionality for beginners if someone is crazy enough to try to start using \LaTeX from that. Feel free to use it as well if you want. I know it's not ideal but good enough for me.
